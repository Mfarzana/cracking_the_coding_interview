
## Binary Tree
Binary tree is a tree which each node has up to two children.

### Binary Tree Traversal
 * In-Order Traversal: Left Root Right 
 * Pre-Order Traversal: Root Left Right
 * Post-Order Traversal: Left Right Root
 
### Complete Binary Trees
Every level of the tree is fully filled **except for the perhaps the last level**. In the last level, nodes might or might not be filled fully. Also, letâ€™s note that **all the nodes should be filled from the left**.
### Full Binary Tree
A full binary tree is a binary tree in which every **node has eihter zero or two children**.
### Perfect Binary Trees
A perfect binary tress is one that is **both full and complete**.
